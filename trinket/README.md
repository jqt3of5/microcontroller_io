Trinket
=======

This directory contains 3 different io libraries for the Adafruit Trinket.
* I2C over Two Wire Interface
* LSM303 (A 3d accelerometer, magnetometer, thermometer)
* 24AA256 (An EEPROM)

To link and compile these libraries (As well as compile your own trinket firmware) you're going to need the avr toolchain 
[Linux](http://www.atmel.com/tools/ATMELAVRTOOLCHAINFORLINUX.aspx)
[Windows](http://www.atmel.com/tools/ATMELAVRTOOLCHAINFORWINDOWS.aspx)

You'll also need AVRDUDE to program these things in windows. Which comes with  [WinAVR](http://winavr.sourceforge.net/). WinAVR will also include the AVR Toolchain.
